Paints at the time contained high amounts of lead salts, and Caravaggio certainly indulged in the kind of violent behavior that is common with victims of lead poisoning.

Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or decoupage. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with gouache, into shapes of varying colors and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually grew into room-sized murals."

        "answerDescription": "Leonardo's greatest triumph was the smile of the Mona Lisa, which he started working on in 1503 and continued laboring over nearly until his death 16 years later. His distinctive approach was to apply the glaze in extraordinarily thin strokes and then very slowly, over months and years, apply additional layer upon thin layer. The result is a masterpiece that invites and responds to human interactions--a smile that seems to react to our gaze."

In fact, the Mustang was perhaps the most successful product launch in automotive history. Racking up over 22,000 sales in its first day and one million sales in its first two years, the Mustang inspired a wave of imitators including the Pontiac Firebird, Mercury Cougar and Chevrolet Camaro, but none could match the success enjoyed by the Mustang. Originally named for the P-51 Mustang, a fighter plane, Ford's new car quickly became associated with the horse of the same name and this became the basis for the now-famous Mustang emblem.

Triceratops, which is believed to have lived in herds much like modern buffalo, had three distinctive horns -- one on its snout and two more above the eyes. Along with the bony frill that protected the rear of its skull, these horns provided a natural defense against the attacks of other dinosaurs, but the Triceratops was himself an herbivore, feeding on plants and shrubbery with his sharp beak."

He named this one Brontosaurus, meaning \"thunder lizard.\" When later paleontologists examined the two fossils, however, they determined that both skeletons belonged to the same animal class, one being an adult and one being a juvenile. Since the Apatosaurus was discovered and named first, it became the official name. The Brontosaurus, however, had captured the imagination of the public and continued to be preferred by the general public. It was not until the 1980s, when the United States Post Office was taken to task by paleontologists for issuing a stamp depicting the creature and using the improper name, that people even began to be aware of the controversy. Since that time, most dinosaur literature has begun using the proper name Apatosaurus, often with a footnote that these massive dinosaurs used to be called \"Brontosaurus.\""

Fabien Knoll and colleagues disputed this for Diplodocus and Camarasaurus in 2006, finding that the opening for the facial nerve in the braincase was small. The facial nerve was thus not enlarged as in elephants, where it is involved in operating the sophisticated musculature of the proboscis. However, Knoll and colleagues also noted that the facial nerve for Giraffatitan (a close relative of Brachiosaurus) was larger, and could therefore not discard the possibility of a proboscis in this genus."

Although he is generally depicted as a ruthless killer, Billy only wanted to avenge the murder of his employer who treated him like a son. Only four of the men Billy shot actually died, and these may all be considered acts of self-defense or self-preservation. At the age of 21, Billy paid the ultimate price for his violent lifestyle when he was shot and killed by sheriff Pat Garrett in a pitch black room at Fort Sumner. Many years later, a man calling himself Brushy Bill Roberts claimed to be Billy the Kid. He claimed that Garrett had mistakenly killed a man by the name of Billy Barlow. These claims were never verified."

The woman bandit became an overnight sensation, and after her arrest, crowds gathered at the courthouse to get her autograph. She claimed to have committed the robbery because she needed money for her ailing mother, and the sympathetic jury released her, but when she was picked up a few months later for carrying an illegal weapon, she was sent to Yuma Territorial Prison where she earned the distinction of not only being the first woman sent there, but also the first woman to become pregnant while in prison! As the only men who had been alone with her were the prison guards, a preacher, and the Governor of Arizona, Pearl was discretely pardoned and asked to leave the state."

It was difficult for a woman to make a living in the American West, especially if she did not have the protection of a father or husband, and many single women turned to prostitution as their only option. According to historical accounts, Charlie Utter's famous wagon train of prostitutes arrived in Deadwood in 1876 to find miners lined up along the street and cheering their arrival. The women were accompanied by two madams who had chosen the professional names Madam Dirty Em and Madam Mustachio. Prostitution proved to be a thriving industry in the male dominated town of Deadwood and continued almost without interruption until the State's Attorney's Office closed the last four brothels in 1980."

McCurdy's unclaimed corpse was then embalmed with an arsenic preparation and sold by the undertaker to a traveling carnival that exhibited it as a sideshow curiosity. For about 60 years, McCurdy's body was bought and sold by various haunted houses and wax museums for use as a prop or attraction. His corpse finally wound up at The Pike, an amusement park funhouse in a Long Beach, California. During filming there in 1976 for the television show The Six Million Dollar Man, a prop man moved what was thought to be a wax mannequin that was hanging from a gallows. When the mannequin's arm broke off, a human bone and muscle tissue were visible. Subsequent testing by the Los Angeles coroner's office revealed the prop was actually McCurdy, and he was buried at the famous Boot Hill cemetery in Dodge City, Kansas, 66 years after his death."

He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ. Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: \"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.\" The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.\""

They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep. Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, \"Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.\" So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away. Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. \"For the last fourteen days,\" he said, \"you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven't eaten anything. Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. No one of you will lose a single hair from his head.\" After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. Altogether there were 276 of us on board. When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf. The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping. But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety. Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.\""

Before the Queensbery Rules were introduced in 1867, each round of a fight would last until someone was knocked down. The decked boxer would then have 30 seconds to make it to his feet and back to the line in the middle of the ring known as \"the scratch\". There was no time limit nor was there any limit to the number of rounds. Because of this many fights at this time would end in draws."

After the war, the league, with the encouragement of Madison Square Garden management, reneged on a longstanding promise to allow the Americans to return. Red Dutton, the coach and general manager of the Americans, bitterly declared that the Rangers would never win the Cup for as long as he lived. Dutton's Curse apparently worked. When he died in 1987 at the age 88, the Rangers were in their 47th season without having won the Cup."
